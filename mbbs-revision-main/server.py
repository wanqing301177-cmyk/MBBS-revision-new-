"""MBBS Revision — self-hosted study server.

Serves the frontend, parses uploaded PPTX/PDF files, proxies OpenAI-compatible
LLM calls (DeepSeek for text, Alibaba Bailian/Qwen-VL for vision), and persists
everything in a local SQLite database so multiple devices share one account.

Auth: a single password (set via PASSWORD env var or defaulted) guards every
/api/* endpoint. Sessions use HMAC-signed bearer tokens.

# What the site is *for*. The generation prompts are built from this instead of
# hard-coded medical wording, so one checkout can serve a medicine programme and
# a science programme at once (each instance picks a preset and may then edit it).
#
# Each subject carries:
#   focus    - the extraction dimensions that replace the old hard-coded medical
#              list ("anatomy, pathology, clinical features, ..."). This is what
#              makes the notes specific to the discipline.
#   keywords - matched (case-insensitively) against a lesson title to bind it to
#              this subject automatically. The LONGEST match wins, so put a more
#              specific subject's keywords first when they overlap.
