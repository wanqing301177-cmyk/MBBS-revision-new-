"""Merge duplicated knowledge points inside existing lessons.

Why exact-title matching is not enough
--------------------------------------
Two things put the same content into a lesson twice:

  * the generator's coverage pass used to re-send the WHOLE lecture to the
    model instead of only the slides that had produced no point, so the model
    re-emitted every point of the lecture a second time — with a slightly
    longer title ("菲克第一定律" vs "菲克第一定律（Fick's first law）的数学表达式");
  * a lesson was regenerated or merged and the earlier, briefer points stayed.

In both cases the two copies usually sit on the SAME slide and their titles
differ only by extra detail, so the rule set below looks at the title's shape
plus the body's vocabulary rather than at an exact string:

  R1  same normalised title                                -> keep the first
  R2  short title is a PREFIX of the long one              -> keep the long one
  R3  short title is a SUBSTRING of the long one           -> keep the long one
  R4  bodies nearly identical AND titles nearly identical  -> keep the richer one

Guard: titles of the same length that differ in at most two characters are a
contrastive pair (Aα vs Aβ fibres, 谷氨酸 vs 赖氨酸, 细胞 vs 细胞器 level) and are
never merged by R2–R4 — those points are genuinely about different things.

# share five of seven words because a pharmacology lecture titles half its points
# "<drug>: dose range and adverse effect profile", so the term-coverage check
# above was satisfied by the scaffolding while the one word that must never be
# lost — the drug itself — was missing from the survivor. The same happened to
# cocaine/ketamine and methamphetamine/psilocybin.
#
# So any NAME-like term of the entry being deleted must appear in the survivor's
# text somewhere. Name-like means a long latin word outside the generic title
# vocabulary (dose, range, adverse, profile, mechanism …) or a CJK run of two or
# more characters. This is what stops an entity swap from passing as a rewrite.
# Words that only glue a title together: dropping one of these never loses a fact.
# Everything else in a title is CONTENT and must be found in the survivor before the
# other copy may be deleted. Contrastive adjectives deliberately stay content —
# primary/secondary, vulvar/vaginal, typical/atypical — because treating them as
# generic is exactly what produced "Primary Disorder → Secondary Disorder" and
# "vulvar squamous tumours → vaginal squamous tumours" merges.
